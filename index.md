I develop games, illustrate, and play music! I love exploring the intersection between creative expression and technical precision. This website maintains past projects that I'm proud to share.

I study Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've been fortunate to work with great mentors and peers at [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/), [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/), [Uken Games](https://www.uken.com/), and [Kik](https://www.kik.com/). If you're looking for my qualifications, [here is my résumé](/assets/files/resume_w16.pdf).
